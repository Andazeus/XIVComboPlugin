# XIVAndaComboPlugin
This is a fork of Daemitus' version of the XIVComboPlugin that implements combos for the Reaper job.'

## Note
The combos are just speculation based on the published official job guide. They may not be efficient or practical and might be bugged. Use at your own risk.
This addon will become obsolete once Reaper functionality is rolled into XIVCombo.

## Installation
* Type `/xlplugins` in-game to access the plugin installer and updater. Any releases on this github page have been removed to facilitate proper installation going forward.
## In-game usage
* Type `/pcombo` to pull up a GUI for editing active combo replacements.
* Drag the named ability from your ability list onto your hotbar to use.
  * For example, to use DRK's Souleater combo, first check the box, then place Souleater on your bar. It should automatically turn into Hard Slash.
  * The description associated with each combo should be enough to tell you which ability needs to be placed on the hotbar.
